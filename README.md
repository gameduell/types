## Description

This library gives low level data structures that are optimized for flash, html5 and cpp targets.
It is mostly built on top of a binary data structure called Data. Data provides a binary allocation and access API that minimizes object creation. Reduced object creation is the fact that you do not create a view if you need to access a specific data type on it.
The library also provides platform accelerated APIs for Matrix calculations.

## Usage:

In order to learn how to use it refer to the tests present in the tests folder.
